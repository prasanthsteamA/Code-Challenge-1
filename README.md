##  Code-Challenge-1

## Scenario 1
In a futuristic city, a brilliant scientist unveils a revolutionary time-travel device. However, a glitch in the system prevents him from accessing specific time coordinates. Desperate for a solution, he seeks a coding genius to fix the issue and extract crucial data from the past. Will you be the one to decipher the temporal anomaly and save the scientist's groundbreaking invention?

## Scenario 2

As the final round approaches, the gamer's performance is evaluated by an intelligent grading system. With a score in hand, the gamer eagerly anticipates the letter grade that will determine their standing among the elite players. Can you help them decipher the grading system and secure the coveted 'A' grade, solidifying their status as a gaming prodigy?

Alas, for all the money in the world, he can't find a decent programmer to help him with this task. He's designed the front-end of the application and it looks great.
